        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Life is about growth and learning. As such, my journey through life has been one of exploration and curiosity. After high school, I achieved high honors in my Bachelor's Degree in Video Game Design. After college I became of CAD Designer for an industrial engineering firm where we design and manufacture the linings of furnaces where refined metals are created.</p>
        <p>Now, it's time for the start of a new adventure. I'm an aspiring web designer who loves all things tech related. I'm a life-long learner who's always interested in growing and achieving new things.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to read, play video games, and write. Since graduating college, I've written two novels and a few short stories.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Swift</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My goal is to join a firm that helps clients turn their dreams into a reality.</p>
        <p>The web has become a wonderfully interconnected atmosphere for progress and new ideas, and it's up to us as developers to make those atmopsheres as interactive and accessible as possible.</p>
